## üöÄ Haazrri - Smart Attendance System  
üìå A smart way to **prevent proxies** in attendance marking!

Keeping track of student attendance while preventing proxies is a labor-intensive and manual task for teachers. **Haazrri** is designed to solve this problem by providing a **complete attendance and anti-proxy solution**.


## ‚ö°Features

- **Proxy Prevention** using FPS-based pattern matching  
- **Email and Password Validation** for secure access  
- **Role-Based Access Control** with separate functionalities for students and teachers
- 
 ## ‚ö°Future scope
- **Dashboard** for efficient attendance tracking
- **IP address based authentication** for preventing proxy login
- **Facial recognition** 

## üí°Anti-Proxy System

**Haazrri** is primarily designed to prevent proxy attendance using a **video pattern recognition system**.

### How It Works:

1. **Pattern Generation**:  
   - When a teacher clicks **‚ÄúCreate Attendance‚Äù**, Haazrri generates a randomized black-and-white frame pattern at a random FPS (frames per second) between **20 and 30**.
   
2. **Attendance Marking**:  
   - When a student clicks **‚ÄúMark Attendance‚Äù**, their phone camera opens, and a recording of the displayed pattern is captured.

3. **Pattern Recognition & Verification**:  
   - The backend, powered by **OpenCV**, processes the recorded sequence.  
   - If the captured pattern matches the generated one, attendance is marked successfully.  
   - If mismatched, the student must retry.

### Why It Prevents Proxy Attendance:

 
- **Synchronization Requirement**: The student's camera must match the generated FPS exactly.  
- **Proxy Attempts via Video Calls Fail**:  
  - Video calls introduce **FPS fluctuations** due to network instability.  
  - Manually setting and maintaining an exact FPS in a video call is **not practically possible**.  
  - Any **frame duplication or loss** corrupts the pattern, preventing proxy attendance.

By leveraging these techniques, **Haazrri ensures that only students who are physically present can successfully mark attendance.**
